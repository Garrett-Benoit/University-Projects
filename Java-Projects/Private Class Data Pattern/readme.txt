This project is a test implementation of a design pattern known as the private class data pattern.

Pattern:  Private Class Data Pattern
Problem:  A class may expose its attributes to manipulation when it is no longer intended.
Solution: The PCD design reduces exposure of attributes and limits variable visibility.
Consequences: Limits the view of object flow and overall understanding of data control.
