This project is a test implementation of a design pattern known as the builder pattern.

Pattern:  Builder Pattern
Problem:  A system that uses complex aggregation which has one of many representations that needs to be built.
Solution: The algorithms for interpreting the data is separated from the algorithms which represent and build the data.
Consequences: The builder pattern requires code duplication.

This project was written in Eclipse (Oxygen.1)
