This project is a test implementation of a design pattern known as the singleton pattern.

Pattern:  Singleton Pattern
Problem:  A system or application that needs one, and only one, instance of an object.
Solution: The class of the singleton object is responsible for creation, initalization, access, and enforcement.
Consequences: The singleton pattern does not support subclassing.  Furthermore the singleton pattern should be only used when:
              1.) Ownership of the instance cannot be reasonably assigned
              2.) Lazy initialization is desirable
              3.) Global access is not otherwise provided

This project was written in Eclipse (Oxygen.1)
